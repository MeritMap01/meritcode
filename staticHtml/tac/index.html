                applicable taxes will be shown at check-out before you complete your purchase. We may change our prices
                at any time. All payments shall be in the currency indicated on the payment page.</p>
              <p>You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorize
                us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon making your purchase. If your
                purchase is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on a
                recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until you notify us of
                your cancellation. For certain products or services, we offer a payment plan option that allows you to
                receive the product or service upfront, in exchange for future payments. Failure to make future payments
                as agreed may result in reporting of your information to credit bureaus or similar credit reporting
                entities and appearing on your credit report.</p>
